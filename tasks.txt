### SERVER
	1. Testing controllers:
		1.1 userController	---> OK

			1.1.1 checkUserMiddleware / role checking / ---> OK
			1.1.2 why after decode JSON we have object with *dataValues* and *_previusDataValues*?
					because these fields has user object from postgresql db

		1.2 brandController ---> OK
		1.3 typeController --->	OK
		1.4 reviewController ---> OK
		1.5 ratingController ---> OK
			note: In my opinion, a better way to implement the rating logic was to upadate 
			      the furniture object in the database immediately after creating the rating object, which I did
		1.6 additionalVatiantController ---> OK
		1.7 basketController ---> OK
		1.8 basketFurnitureController ---> OK
		1.9 furnitureController ---> OK
			1.9.1 when a data will gets in JSON.stringify forma I need to use JSON.parse

		1.10 purchaseHistoryController ---> OK
